### TAJ MAHAL ###

It was built by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan in 1631 in memory of his third but the most favourite wife, in fact a soul-mate Mumtaz Mahal, a ***Muslim Persian princess***. She died while accompanying her husband in Burhanpur in a campaign to crush a ***rebellion*** after giving birth to their 13th child.
